Flask Templates
===============

Previous:

1. `Flask intro <flask.html>`_: A very simple Flask app

2. `Flask, part 2 <flask2.html>`_: Values in routes; using an API

Code for this chapter is `here <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/tree/master/python_code_examples/flask>`_.

In the previous Flask chapters, we wrote some HTML directly into the Flask app script. This is very awkward. Naturally, Flask provides a better way to store the HTML (and CSS) you will want your Flask functions to generate.

Folder structure for a Flask app
--------------------------------

A proper Flask app is going to use multiple files — some of which will be template files. The organization of these files has to follow rules so the app will work. Here is a diagram of the typical structure: ::


    my-flask-app
       ├── static/
       │   └── css/
       │       └── main.css
       ├── templates/
       │   ├── index.html
       │   └── student.html
       ├── data.py
       └── students.py


1. Everything the app needs is in one folder, here named *my-flask-app*.

2. That folder contains two folders, specifically named *static* and *templates*.

   * The *static* folder contains **assets** used by the templates, including CSS files, JavaScript files, and images. In the example, we have only one asset file, *main.css*. Note that it’s inside a *css* folder that’s inside the *static* folder.

   * The *templates* folder contains only templates. These have an ``.html`` extension. As we will see, they contain more than just regular HTML.


3. In addition to the *static* and *templates* folders, this app also contains ``.py`` files. Note that these must be *outside* the two folders named *static* and *templates*.

.. attention:: The templates will not work if this folder structure is not exactly as described above. Your app folder can be named anything (not only *my-flask-app*), but the **static** and **templates** folders must be named and organized as shown above. The *static* folder can contain multiple folders and files. The names of files are up to you.

Get started with templates
--------------------------

Let’s first imagine a situation where we are going to need a lot of pages that all have the same layout.

For example, we might want to build an app that includes all the U.S. presidents. Each president will have their own page, like this:

.. figure:: _static/images/prespage.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: President page screenshot

We do not want to build 45 pages by hand. We happen to have all the presidential data `in a spreadsheet <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/blob/master/python_code_examples/flask/presidents/presidents.csv>`_. Can we make *one HTML template* and be done?

Yes!

Here is an excerpt from that template: ::

    <h1>{{ pres['President'] }}</h1>

    <p>{{ pres['President'] }}, the {{ ord }} president of the
       United States, was born on {{ pres['Birth-date'] }}, in
       {{ pres['Birthplace'] }}. He was {{ pres['Age-when-took-office'] }}
       when he took office on {{ pres['Took-office'] }}. Member:
       {{ pres['Party'] }} Party.</p>

That might look slightly intimidating, but notice that inside each double-pair of curly braces is a **key** (in square brackets) that tells you exactly which information item will appear there. So, for Lincoln:

   *Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was born on 2/12/1809, in LaRue County, Kentucky. He was 52 when he took office on 3/4/1861. Member: Republican/National Union Party.*

The spreadsheet was converted to a list of Python dictionaries — one dictionary per president. The dictionary for Lincoln looks like this: ::

    {'Presidency': '16', 'President': 'Abraham Lincoln', 'Wikipedia-entry':
       'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln', 'Took-office': '3/4/1861',
       'Left-office': '4/15/1865', 'Party': 'Republican/National Union', 'Home-state':
       'Illinois', 'Occupation': 'Lawyer', 'College': 'None', 'Age-when-took-office':
       '52', 'Birth-date': '2/12/1809', 'Birthplace': 'LaRue County, Kentucky',
       'Death-date': '4/15/1865', 'Location-death': 'Washington, D.C.', 'Image': 'pr16.jpg'}


How does a Flask app use a template?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the previous chapter, `Flask, part 2 <flask2.html>`_, you saw this route function: ::

    @app.route('/user/<name>')
    def user(name):
        personal = f'<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>'
        instruc = '<p>Change the name in the <em>browser address bar</em> \
            and reload the page.</p>'
        return personal + instruc

Let’s transform that so it uses a template.

1. Put the HTML into a template (note the double curly braces ``{{ }}`` around *name*): ::

    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>

    <p>Change the name in the <em>browser address bar</em>
        and reload the page.</p>

2. Save the template file as *hello.html* in the *templates* folder.

3. Edit the route function. Remove the HTML. Change the return statement — call the ``render_template`` function. That is how we get the template! ::

    @app.route('/user/<name>')
    def user(name):
        return render_template('hello.html', name=name)

4. We must **import** the ``render_template`` module, so add it to the line at the top of the Flask app script: ::

    from flask import Flask, render_template


When you import more than one module from *flask,* you can put them on one line, separated by commas.

.. note:: The template needs to be a complete HTML file, with all the usual elements such as HTML, HEAD, and BODY. See the complete example below.


.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/first_template_ex/templates/hello.html
   :caption:
   :language: html


.. attention:: In the HEAD above, in the LINK element, note the syntax for linking to a file in the *static* folder. The CSS file is just a normal CSS file, but it must be in the *static* folder for the Flask app.

Syntax for a path to **a file** in the *static* folder: ::

    href="{{ url_for('static', filename='main.css') }}"

Syntax for a path to **a file inside a folder** in the *static* folder: ::

    scr="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/foo.jpg') }}"



Example: hello4.py

☞ `All the “hello” app’s files are here. <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/tree/master/python_code_examples/flask/first_template_ex>`_



How are variables passed from app to template?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The templates in Flask are handled by the Jinja template engine, which comes with Flask when you first install it.

The ``render_template()`` function both selects the template file to be used and passes to it any values or variables it needs. ::

    return render_template('example.html',
        name=name, phone=phone_number, state='FL')

We can pass as many variables as necessary to the template. In the example above, the **template** must contain variables for *name, phone,* and *state.* That is, these expressions must be somewhere in the template named *example.html*: ::

    {{ name }}
    {{ phone }}
    {{ state }}

The *value* (on the right side of the equals sign) must come from the code in the Flask app file. In the example above, both *name* and *phone_number* must already have a value before the ``return render_template()`` line. Note that ``'FL'`` is a string — we can pass in a string, integer, float, or Boolean.

It’s also possible to pass lists or dictionaries as *values* to a template. Here’s a line from `the presidents app <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/tree/master/python_code_examples/flask/presidents>`_: ::

    return render_template('president.html',
        pres=pres_dict, ord=ord, the_title=pres_dict['President'])

The template file is named *president.html,* and the values depend on a Python dictionary, ``pres_dict``, that was defined earlier in the Flask app script. We can see the following expressions in the template’s HTML: ::

    {{ ord }}
    {{ pres['President'] }}
    {{ pres['Birth-date'] }}
    {{ pres['Birthplace'] }}

Why ``pres`` and not ``pres_dict``? Because ``pres=pres_dict``. In the ``render_template()`` function call, the dictionary ``pres_dict`` is assigned to the template’s variable ``pres``. It is shorter and simpler for use in the template file.

If you need help understanding Python dictionaries, see the `Dictionaries chapter <dicts.html>`_. Dictionaries are incredibly useful for Flask templates!

In another template in `the presidents app <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/tree/master/python_code_examples/flask/presidents>`_, *base.html,* we can see this expression in the HEAD element: ::

    <title>{{ the_title }}</title>

Because of ``the_title=pres_dict['President']``, the HTML TITLE element will be filled in with the value of the dictionary item that has the **key** ``'President'``.

.. figure:: _static/images/prestitle.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: President title screenshot

Recall that the HTML TITLE is visible in the browser tab, as seen above.

.. attention:: If a template uses a lot of variables, it’s *much* shorter and easier to pass a dictionary to the template than to specify all the individual variables in the ``render_template()`` function.



Walkthrough of the presidents app
---------------------------------

Now we will examine this app so you can build one like it yourself.

Converting a CSV to a list of dictionaries
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All the data we need about the U.S. presidents is in `this CSV file <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/blob/master/python_code_examples/flask/presidents/presidents.csv>`_.

Early in the Flask app in *presidents.py,* we create a **list** of dictionaries named ``presidents_list`` from that CSV. Each **item** in the list is a dictionary. Each dictionary contains all the data about ONE president. That is, **each dictionary** is equivalent to **one row** from the original CSV. (This is covered in `the CSVs chapter <csv.html#reading-into-a-dictionary>`_.)

We can use ``presidents_list`` to:

1. Populate a template with all the data about a selected president.

2. Use a unique ID number — in the **key** ``'Presidency'`` — to determine which president has been selected. This will be used in the Flask **route**: ::

    @app.route('/president/<num>')

3. Create a list of pairs in which each pair consists of the unique ID and the name of the president it belongs to. This will be used to create an HTML list of all the presidents’ names, which are links to the Flask route.

Here is the top of the *presidents.py* script:

.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/presidents/presidents.py
   :lines: 1-8
   :linenos:
   :caption:

The list is created on line 8, using a function in an external file named *modules.py*. The function ``convert_to_dict()`` was imported from that file on line 2.

.. tip:: To store non-Flask functions in a separate *.py* file, you will import them by name from that file, as seen on line 2 in *presidents.py*. One more thing is required: In the folder that contains both *presidents.py* and *modules.py* there must also be a file named *__init__.py*. That file can be **empty** — but the name must be exactly as shown. `More details here. <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html>`_

The route to one selected president
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will skip to the second route in the app and come back to the first one later.

.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/presidents/presidents.py
   :lines: 24-32
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 24
   :caption:


Notice that the variable ``num`` is passed in the route. This was explained in `Flask, part 2 <flask2.html>`_. The value of ``num`` determines *which president* we will see. ::

    @app.route('/president/<num>')

Earlier, we saw that a URL for Abraham Lincoln ends with */president/16*.

Recall that each president’s details are in a **dictionary,** and all the dictionaries are in a **list.** Recall that any list **item** can be accessed by its **index** (see `Working with Lists <lists.html>`_).

However, the first index in a list is always 0.

To get George Washington, the first U.S. president, we need ``presidents_list[0]``. But the route URL will end with */president/1* — because his Presidency (`in the CSV <https://github.com/macloo/python-adv-web-apps/blob/master/python_code_examples/flask/presidents/presidents.csv>`_) is 1. Therefore: ::

    pres_dict = presidents_list[int(num) - 1]

That line (line 27) assigns the dictionary for the one selected president to the variable ``pres_dict``. For the list index, ``int(num) - 1`` changes ``num`` from a string to an integer and subtracts 1, so that the dictionary for George Washington, first president, comes from list item 0. (And the dictionary for Abraham Lincoln, 16th president, comes from list item 15, etc..)

.. attention:: This would not work for every possible list of dictionaries. In some cases you would need to search for a dictionary key to match the value passed to the function from the route URL.

Line 27 is in a ``try`` clause because it’s possible someone would manually change the URL to something invalid, such as */president/100*. In that case, the ``except`` clause would run, and the screen would show the text “Invalid value for Presidency: 100” styled as an H1 heading.

Line 31 is a bonus because it takes the value of ``num`` (e.g. 1 for Washington or 16 for Lincoln) and converts it to an ordinal (e.g. 1st for Washington or 16th for Lincoln). The function ``make_ordinal()`` is in *modules.py.*

Finally, line 32 is the ``render_template()`` function we’ve seen before. The Flask template here is *president.html.* We know that ``pres_dict`` is the single dictionary for the selected president, and we pass it to the template as the variable ``pres`` because that’s shorter and simpler. We pass ``ord`` to the template as ``ord``. For the HTML TITLE, we pass the value of ``pres_dict['President']`` to the template as ``the_title``.

**Summary:** The route tells Flask, "When this URL is received, run the following function." Then everything up to the final ``return`` in the function is preparing the data that will be in the ``render_template()`` function. We also have an ``except`` clause, in case the route’s variable value is unusable.

The route to an index of presidents
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now we turn to the first route. This is the equivalent of an index, where the user selects a president. Then a request is sent to the server, and the page for that single president appears in the browser.

The web page needs to provide a list of links, one for each president.

* To work, the partial URL for a president must contain the Presidency number. This was covered in the previous section — the URL for Abraham Lincoln, for example, ends with */president/16*.

* The link text is the president's name. In the CSV, it is in the column named President.

.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/presidents/presidents.py
   :lines: 12-20
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 12
   :caption:

A list of pairs (number, name) is created before the route function. It’s *outside* the route function because it only needs to run *once* and create the ``pairs_list`` list for the route function to use.

This is a simple route for the top page of the app: ::

    @app.route('/')

Because ``pairs_list`` already exists, the function has only one instruction: to return ``render_template()``. The ``render_template()`` function specifies the template named ``index.html`` (this is always the *first thing* inside the parentheses) and passes to it the ``pairs_list`` (assigned to ``pairs``) and the string *"Presidents Index"* (assigned to ``the_title``).

`You can see the result here. <https://presidents-flask.herokuapp.com/>`_


The presidents templates
------------------------

There are three templates in this app:

1. *index.html*
2. *president.html*
3. *base.html*

base.html
+++++++++

We begin with *base.html* because it is used by both of the other templates.

.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/presidents/templates/base.html
   :language: html
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 7,10,18,19
   :caption:

We already covered the code in lines 7 and 10 (earlier in this chapter):

* Line 7: The value for the template variable ``the_title`` comes from the ``render_template()`` function.

* Line 10: The value inside quotes following ``href=`` is necessary for a functioning path to files inside the *static* folder.

What’s new: The **Jinja directives** on lines 18 and 19. These two commands, specific to the Jinja template language, designate the *start* and *end* of a **block.** The block in this case is named *content.* This same block name will be used in the other two templates in the presidents app.

.. note:: The block can be named something else (other than *content*). Up to you. Also, you can use more than one block in a template — but each block in a template must have its own unique name.

**What is a block for?** It is a place to insert other content.

Read on ...


index.html
++++++++++

Right away, look at lines 3 and 20 below. Those are the same **Jinja directives** used in *base.html* — but here, they enclose *the block to be inserted* into *base.html.*

It works because of line 1 below:

.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/presidents/templates/index.html
   :language: html
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,15,17,20
   :caption:

Because of line 1, when the ``render_template()`` function calls the template *index.html,* the first thing that happens is: line 1 fetches *base.html* and constructs a complete page from the two templates.

You’ll see the same thing in the *president.html* template, again using *base.html.*

The other Jinja code in *index.html* is used to build a list of links. This was described under `The route to an index of presidents <#the-route-to-an-index-of-presidents>`_ above.

First, the two **Jinja directives** on lines 15 and 17 designate the start and end of a for-loop. It is a Python for-loop, as you might realize when you see that it begins with ``for pair in pairs`` — but note, there is *no colon.*

Second, what is happening *inside* the for-loop? The list named ``pairs`` contains a *tuple* for each president. In each tuple are two values, a number and a name. Values in a tuple can be used with indexes, like values in a list. So ``pair[0]`` is the *first* value in the current tuple (a number), and ``pair[1]`` is the *second* value (a president’s name). ::

    <li><a href="{{ url_for( 'detail', num=pair[0] ) }}">{{ pair[1] }}</a></li>

1. The for-loop writes a new LI element each time the loop runs.
2. The LI contains one A element.
3. The value of the HREF attribute is this string: ::

    "{{ url_for( 'detail', num=pair[0] ) }}"

4. The value inside ``{{ }}`` writes, for example: ``/president/16``.
5. Because ``pair[1]`` holds a president’s name, that name is the link text.
6. The result of the loop looks like this: ::

    <li><a href="/president/1">George Washington</a></li>
    <li><a href="/president/2">John Adams</a></li>
    <li><a href="/president/3">Thomas Jefferson</a></li>
    <li><a href="/president/4">James Madison</a></li>
    <li><a href="/president/5">James Monroe</a></li>
    ...

You might have wondered why the second route in *presidents.py* starts like this: ::

    @app.route('/president/<num>')
    def detail(num):

I wanted to demonstrate that the value of the HREF attribute *must* call the *function,* which here is ``detail()`` and **not** ``president()``.

When the **HTTP request** is *http://localhost:5000/president/16,* the function ``detail()`` receives the string value *16* as ``num``.

The value of ``num`` retrieves the matching dictionary and returns it — with the template — as the **HTTP response,** and the browser displays the selected president’s page.


president.html
++++++++++++++

The detail page contains the most Jinja templating code, because it is writing all the values from one president’s dictionary (``pres``) into the HTML:

.. literalinclude:: ../python_code_examples/flask/presidents/templates/president.html
   :language: html
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,14,16,18,23,25,33
   :caption:

This template inserts itself into *base.html* because of lines 1, 3 and 33. Those are **Jinja block directives,** already discussed above.

In *index.html* you saw a Python for-loop in Jinja. Here you can see conditional statements — *if* and *elif.* This is especially powerful because we can read the values from the dictionary ``pres`` and change what is written into the HTML depending on (for example) whether the president has died or is still living.

Line 14 checks whether the value of ``Death-date`` is the same as the value of ``Left-office``. If so, this president died in office.

Line 16 checks whether the value of ``Left-office`` is *Incumbent.* If not, then this president has left office, and a sentence will be inserted. If so, then no sentence will be inserted.

Line 18 ends the if-else sequence. This is required.

Line 23 checks the value of ``Location-death``. If the value is not *NA,* then this president has died, and a sentence will be written. Otherwise, no sentence is written here.

Line 25 ends the if-else sequence. This is required.

For answers to any questions about writing templates or using the Jinja template language:

* `Jinja documentation <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/>`_ — All the commands for the Jinja template syntax are here.

* `Flask documentation <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates>`_ for ``render_template()``.


Summary
-------

* Using Flask to ingest a URL and return a templated web page requires us to consider the data source (a CSV in the presidents app), the layout of the page, and the variables we need to send to the page.

* A Flask route function can be long or short, and if it returns ``render_template()`` it needs to send not only the name of the template but also the variables required by that template.

* In templates, partial URLs are written in very particular ways to work with the Jinja template engine. These include all URLs that lead to assets inside the *static* folder, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

* Any **link** that corresponds to *a route that includes a variable* requires particular Jinja syntax, as seen in *index.html.*

* Jinja directives can be used to insert Python commands into a template. These include for-loops and conditionals (*if, elif, else*). You might notice this resembles PHP syntax.

* Templates can be modular. In the presidents app, *base.html* contains HTML for the top and bottom segments of two different pages. The middle segment is inserted by either *index.html* or *president.html.*

.. note:: Data sources other than CSV files — including databases — can be used with Flask.
